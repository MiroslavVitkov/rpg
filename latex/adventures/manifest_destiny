Inspired by The Outer Limits television series.

Preparation
A red pen and paper for the bloody writings( alternatively, learn to pronounce them in advance ).
White, black and red six-sided die.
A watch for keepeng the suggested timeframe.
Estimated total play time: 1-3 hours.

Approach (10 min)
The captain(1) of science vessel Valkyrie is ordered to board a stranded military craft.
He presents the order to the crew.
The main pilot(2) performs external analysis of the hull and electro magnetic emissions.
All is silent, engines are turned off, the ship is not in any orbit, no sign of the 35 person crew.
The main pilot performs automatic or manual docking.{white-can drain life support and fuel, black: boarding successful, but airlock damaged; red - living matter detected inside ship}
Main pilot (is encouraged to) remain on Valkyrie, the others to board.
Available short-range sensors aboard the Valkyrie:
  - electro-magnetic emissions( light, radio )
  - mechanical vibrations( sound, movement )
  - trajectory, compared to estimated for perfectly rigid body( i.e. are objects inside the craft moving )
  - computer-aided optical analysis( status of heat shields, combat armor, magnetic radiation shield )

Entry (10 min)
It's dark.
Secondary pilot/instruments specialist(3) determines the ship to be operational - both main power and engines.
Lightning can be activated on per-room bases, but life support, propulsion, navigation, logs - are controlled from the bridge.

Bridge (20 min)
Unfinished sandwiches, preserved in the vacuum environment.
Engines and life support online; sensors and communication down due to short-cirquits.
Logs indicate mission was orbital bombardment of a Earth-like planet with no scentient life.
All procedures by the book unil 2 days ago - when the distress beacon was activated; no logs since.
A video log by Virgil Messen, an aquaintance of (1), explains successful bomdardment, according to all instruments.
Airlock of the ship was opened only once this week - by us.
Before that - 6 times in 3 hours, all authorized by the captain's biometric signature.
Following bombardment, the ship shuttle visited planet's surface, returning wit 157kg unspecified load.


Samples storage room (5 min)
Blood smeared across the walls and glassware, no bodies, ship's doctor(4) unable to determine how many people's blood is this.{white-abnormally high neurotransmitter density leaked into blood; black-drops the analyser, while picking it up faints; red-the analyzer suffers a fatal EMC shock.}
If white, (4) immediately remembers, otherwise impose it one him after a couple of rooms: he has a vaccine, (3*crew_number) doses, worth 1 hours each.
"CORTES"( Hernán Cortés de Monroy y Pizarro, 1st Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca was a Spanish Conquistador who led an expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec Empire ). 

Virgil's quarters. (10 min)
Writing in blood  "pervenimus longe prae manibus", latin for "we have reached too far, beyond our grasp", apyone on the Valkyrie can translate this.
Last log is later than bridge logs: "I can't let them get to Earth" spoken in panick.
The roof collapses after several seconds of hammering.
Security officer(5) hallucinates Messen for a moment. {white-feels like a hallucination, but unsure; black-shoots up (2)'s sonar(motion detector), red-feels they are imagining the collapse}
Next (5) has a seisure, upon recovering doesn't remember enetering this room( effects of too many neurons fireing simultaniously ).

Infirmary (10 min)
Massen is there, crouching, repeats over and over: "Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, Creatorem caeli et terrae".
Charges after 30 seconds, is unarmed.
Perished humanoid creatures with third degree burns discovered in crioganic inorganic storage.
(4) immediately notices they are bipedal creatures with opposed thumbs.
Upon opening, enyone upon the Valkyrie suffers massive EMP{white - feels powerless, fires engines at full thrust towards closest sun; black - quickly recovers; red - pronounces "aut vincere aut mori"(either to conquer or to die) and commits suicide}
Upon further examination, (4) could determine their blood is rich in copper, their brains are the size of a house cat, their hands have large matal nails on the inside.

Epilogue (10 min)
A month later, a military scout craft investigates the still active emergency beacon.
They transmit all downloaded information to Earth.
This includes the electro-magnetic consciousnesses of a whole speaces.

Hooks
Use those if time is up and the party needs to proceed to next location.
Whispers - everyone hears the same whisper, they all feel like it would be better to jump out of the airlock, if need be, but not stay in this room.
Footsteps - someone is running just outside!
Communication loss - Valkyrie radio link decaying due to solar flares, other side of the ship more favorable. 
Valkyrie downlink - "hurry up, guys, huge solar flare expected in 3".
Oxigen storage malfuntion - storage tank gets punctured due to electrical discharge melting the metal.
Exit destroyed - the control panel of one of the non-essential doors shorts out and is destroyed.
